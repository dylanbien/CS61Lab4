Note: In delete, we assume that only the body of the post/comment is deleted and the post title as well as all comments/replies remain intact; We also assume that anyone may delete a post or comment, even if they are not the author. For posts - timestamp is updated. For comments - we cannot change the permalink (it's permanent!) so we add a new timestamp field
